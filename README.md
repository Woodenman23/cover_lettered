# Cover Letter AI

This is the application to enable users to automate the production of targeted cover letters when applying to jobs.

It is a flask application that:

- Uploads user's resume
- Takes job description as input
- Generates a cover letter that is tailored to the confluence of the applicant's skills and the employer's requirements

This project is open source, use it as a template to build your own application
if you wish. Or check out this [free tutorial](https://youtu.be/mqhxxeeTbu0?si=OicLhr4NVffZhQWZ)
with techwithtim to start at the same place I did.
